## Service Overview

### Backend Services
- DigitalOcean Droplets with auto-scaling
- Managed Databases with read replicas
- Load Balancers with TLS termination
- OpenTelemetry for distributed tracing

### Frontend Services
- DigitalOcean App Platform deployment
- Global CDN configuration
- Real User Monitoring (RUM)
- Edge caching policies

### Mobile App Services
- WebSockets for push notifications
- Redis for connection persistence
- Mobile performance monitoring
- Secure API communication

## Monitoring & Observability

### Key Metrics
- **Infrastructure**: CPU, memory, disk via DO Monitoring
- **Application**: Prometheus metrics & Grafana dashboards
- **User Experience**: RUM and Sentry error tracking

### Logging
- Centralized logging with DigitalOcean Spaces + Vector
- Structured logging format enforced
- Retention policy: 30 days hot, 1 year cold

## Scaling Procedures

### Vertical Scaling
1. Monitor performance metrics
2. Resize droplets via API during maintenance windows
3. Validate scaling impact

### Horizontal Scaling
1. Configure auto-scaling rules in Load Balancer
2. Set minimum/maximum instance counts
3. Test scaling triggers

### Database Scaling
1. Add read replicas via Managed Database interface
2. Configure connection pooling
3. Update application configuration

## Security Practices

### Network Security
- VPC with private networking
- Cloud Firewall rules reviewed monthly
- DDoS protection enabled

### Application Security
- Automated dependency updates
- Quarterly penetration tests
- CSP headers enforced

### Credential Management
- Secrets stored in DigitalOcean Secrets Manager
- Quarterly credential rotation
- Minimal privilege access policies

## Incident Response

### Severity Classification
| Level     | Response Time | Communication |
|-----------|---------------|---------------|
| Critical  | Immediate     | All channels  |
| Major     | 30 minutes    | Team alerts   |
| Minor     | Next business day | Ticket system |

### Common Runbooks
- **Database Failover**: Automated promotion of read replicas
- **DDoS Mitigation**: Cloud Firewall rate limiting
- **Deployment Rollback**: Versioned App Platform deployments

## Maintenance Schedule

Regular maintenance tasks are performed according to the following schedule:

| Task                      | Frequency  | Owner         |
|---------------------------|------------|---------------|
| OS Updates                | Monthly    | Infrastructure|
| Dependency Updates        | Weekly     | Development   |
| Backup Tests              | Quarterly  | DevOps        |
| Security Audits           | Bi-annual  | Security      |
